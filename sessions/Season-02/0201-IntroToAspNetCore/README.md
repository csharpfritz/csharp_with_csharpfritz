In this **Second Season** of CSharp with CSharpFritz, we're going to learn all about how to build web applications with ASP.NET Core and .NET 5.

### Assumptions

Starting with this season, we are going to assume that you've been through the first season and that you know the basics of working with C#.  Additionally, we're going to assume that you are familiar with the syntax of HTML and CSS.  We'll discuss web server architecture, but no previous web application development experience will be assumed.

## Tools Needed

To get started with ASP.NET Core, you can work on Windows, Mac, or Linux using your favorite text editor.  You can use a full development environment like Visual Studio 2019 on Windows, or something as simple as vim or emacs.
