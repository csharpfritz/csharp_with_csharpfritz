# Session 1203: Creating a Collection Website

In this live-coded session, we will review what we learned in the first MVC session and start building the website.  We'll start by initializing the project, cerating a solution file, and building a model to define our collection item.  We'll also create a new controller and a new view.

## Agenda

1. Initialize the project
2. Create a solution file
3. Build a model for our `CollectionItem`
4. Create a controller for our Collection
5. Create sample data in JSON format
6. Load the sample data from the JSON file
7. Return `CollectionItem` objects to the view
8. Introduce Dependency Injection
9. Introduce a partial view for the `CollectionItem`
10. Reference the partial view
