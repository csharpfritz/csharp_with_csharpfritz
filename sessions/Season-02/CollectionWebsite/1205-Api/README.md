# Session 1205: API and Error Handling

We're building on the previous state of our application that showed content loaded from a JSON file on disk to use application configuration, Entity Framework Core and a SQLite database to present information about our collection.   

## Agenda

1. Refactoring the project to remove references to 'Hats'
2. Introducing IConfiguration
3. Loading configuration
  - appsettings.json
  - Environment Variables
4. Introducing Entity Framework Core
5. Create a DataContext
6. Prepopulate data with Data Seeding

### Notes to add:

- Add link to Configuration documentation
- Load connection string from Configuration
