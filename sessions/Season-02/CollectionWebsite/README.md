# The Collections Sample Website

In order to show a real sample application running ASP.NET Core MVC, we're going to build a simple website to manage a 'Collection' of items.  That collection can be anything that you're interested in: coins, stamps, books, etc.  In this sample, we're going to use a collection of hats.

## Structure of this folder

This folder is built to contain versions of the website as we complete them during each session.  The folders are named by the order of the session and contain a README with information about what was completed in that session.

## Sessions

## Design

This project will be designed so that you can set some basic information about the collection.  We'll build the site so that you can add and manage items in the collection.  We will add database capabilties to store the collection items, as well as security to restrict access to the site.
