    "\n",
    "Memory with C# and .NET is dynamically allocated and reclaimed by the .NET runtime as you no longer reference variables.  The .NET **Garbage Collector** runs occasionally, freeing memory that was previously used by variables.  There are ways to tune the garbage collector and in-depth studies of how it manages memory that are much more advanced than this part of the series.  If you'd like to read more, check the [official .NET garbage collector documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/fundamentals?WT.mc_id=visualstudio-twitch-jefritz)\n",
