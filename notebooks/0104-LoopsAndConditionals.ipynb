    "# Session 4: Loops and Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "Common to every programming language are the concepts of loops or repeated execution of the same block of code and conditional execution of code.  These features are typically manifest as the following statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `for` \n",
    "- `while`\n",
    "- `do`\n",
    "- `if`\n",
    "- `switch` or `case`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two statement-level conditional interactions in C#:  `if` and `switch...case` statements.  `If` statements can be combined with any number of `else if` statements and a single `else` statement to route code flow and interactions across branches of code.  ([Link to official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/if-else))\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a simple `if` statement.  You can re-run this code by clicking on the code and clicking the 'Play' button above or using the `Ctrl+Enter` hotkey"
